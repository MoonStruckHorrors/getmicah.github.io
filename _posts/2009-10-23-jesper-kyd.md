title: Jesper Kyd - The genius
---

(Blog entry from my past blog. Written sometime in 2009)

I've always loved the work of Jesper Kyd. His tracks are just what you need in background while you think or code or whatever. But what makes it truely beautiful, is how these tracks blend so well with the levels in the games. For instance, one of my all-time favorites are the tracks from the Harbor levels of the original Hitman. These tracks are combined together to form a single track - Harbor Themes on the official soundtrack.

The first track from Harbor Themes, which plays just when you arrive at the Rotterdam harbor doesn't have much other than what sound like harbor sounds(for the lack of a better word) playing on a mystic elctronic synth. Just like the level, you've just arrived at night in a dark harbor; are exploring while being spooked by every sound.

The second track is played the moment you enter a strip club. It has an eerily beatiful piano track, soon accompanied by beats. You know stuff is about to go down at this harbor.

And the final track starts looping as soon as you step foot on a ship with a NUKE. Now you're really in it with relentless cymbal rage combined with the parts of the last two tracks. It's a bit less melodic than the previous ones, but still good.

To me, this is heaven - the epitome of video game soundtracks.
